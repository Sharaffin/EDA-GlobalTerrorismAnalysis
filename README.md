<h3 align="center"> AlmaBetter Verfied Project - <a href="https://www.almabetter.com/"> AlmaBetter School </a> </h5>

<p>Terrorism is the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political ,economic, religious or social goal through fear, coercin or intimidation. It is a threat and is the greatest violator of human rights, it challenges the authority of the government and puts the security and sovereignty of a country in jeopardy. Our main aim in the project was to explore and visualize Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is maintained by the University of Maryland. The database has information regarding 1,80,000 terrorist events around the world for the years 1970-2017 with detailed attributes like number of deaths, damage,terrorist groups involved, location etc..</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data Description</h2>

<p>The provided data set has following different columns of over 130 variables. Few of them are given below</p>

**Attacktype1_txt**  -  consists of categories like explosion, armed assault, assassination, kidnapping, unarmed assaults.

**Target1_txt**      -  consists of categorical values like private citizens, military, police, government officials,     transportation,education, religious institution, airports, etc.

**Success**          - '1’if attack was a success. ‘0’if attack was a failure

**Region_txt**       -  Name of the region where the attack happened. Region_txt consists values like East Asia, South Asia, Western Europe, etc

**Day,month,year**   - Calendar details of the event

**Nkill**            - Number of people killed in any event

**Nwounded**         - Number of people wounded in any event

**Property**         - Total property damage happened in any event

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data Pipeline</h2>

● Data Processing : We checked for missing values, column type, column name, duplicate records, identified outliers, numerical categorical data and cleaned the dataset

● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis using tables and graphs to derive the observations from the data

<h2>:floppy_disk: Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to understand and interpret the nature of terrorism. We perceived the START dataset through visual designs. A visualization, which can be used to calculate the total number of attacks, total kill counts, and location based on the selected region and year, provides an interactive interface to explore this dataset. We understood various patterns, trends, and correlation in terrorism through visual interpretation and it provided explanation. This work can be used by curious civilians, security-related policymakers, international organizations hosting worldwide events, foreign investors, and academic researchers for the purpose of understanding terrorism and its nature.</p>
